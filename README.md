# F1 Data Analysis
Welcome to my F1 Data Analysis project! As a passionate fan of Formula 1, my goal is to explore the sport through data by analyzing and visualizing various aspects that intrigue me, from historical trends to driver performance. I hope to uncover insights that I didn't know before and spark your interest in this exciting sport as well.

## Data Sources
The main dataset for this project is [F1DB](https://github.com/f1db/f1db), which I believe is the best resource for historical and race data. A big thank you to the creators for their amazing work!

For more detailed analyses of races, I will also use [FastF1](https://docs.fastf1.dev/), an impressive library that provides comprehensive race telemetry and detailed session data, making it a fantastic tool for in-depth analysis.

## Visualization Method
As a note, my preferred method for creating visualizations is Plotly because of the interactivity it offers, making the visualizations more dynamic and engaging. Unfortunately, Plotly visualizations do not display directly on GitHub. For that reason, the links provided in the next section don't point to the notebooks in the repository, but rather to their nbviewer renderings. In general, apart from the advantage of showcasing Plotly visualizations, I find it to be a better experience to view notebooks on nbviewer rather than the embedded view on GitHub because of the cleaner and more inviting interface.

## Project Overview
The essence of this project is that it will always be a work in progress. I will regularly update this repository with new analyses whenever I find something interesting to add, explore, or discover. Thank you for joining me on this journey!
### Notebooks in the Repository
- [Data Wrangling](data_wrangling.ipynb): In this notebook, I prepare the F1DB dataset for analysis. I explore the dataset to familiarize myself with its structure, clean it up, and simplify it to make it more manageable for later analyses. This section includes a comprehensive explanation of the null values and my reasoning for retaining them rather than deleting them.
- [Races Over Time](races_over_time.ipynb): In this notebook, I explore the growth of Formula 1 from its inception in 1950 to today by examining the number of races held each year. I also analyze the geographical distribution of these races to better understand how the sport has expanded worldwide.
